WHAT IS THE HODL NETWORK?

The HODL Network is the collection of HODL Helpdesks, Kiosks, Nomads, Counters, Stores, and Centers (collectively, the 
‘Concepts’) together with HODL HQ, and its strategic relationships with manufacturers, service providers, and supporting 
organizations. The HODL Network is currently pre-launch, and HODL HQ is soliciting relationships with prospective Franchisees 
and Area Developers in anticipation of a world-wide grand opening of our business model in 20XX. Interested participants who 
wish to open a HODL Concept during our grand opening should register on our website, http://www.SampleWebsite.com, and/or 
contact us as soon as possible to begin contract negotiation, site selection, build-out preparations, and arranging for initial 
inventories.

The mission of the HODL Network is to create local, third-space concepts that:

● Provide a venue and physical help desk for Bitcoin enthusiasts,

● Educate the general public on the proper and safe use of Bitcoin, and

● Support individuals and businesses as they integrate with the Bitcoin Network.

HODL is the world’s first no-fee and open-source retail franchise network. Anyone may become a Franchisee by registering with 
HODL HQ, choosing a Concept, and working with us to select a site for business operations which is not currently encumbered by 
another HODL Franchisee. There are no initial franchise fees to open a Concept. There are no credit or capital requirements. 
There are no required advertising partnerships. The franchisee has discretion over 100% of the P&L, making HODL a unique 
franchise concept in the retail/service sector. Each Concept is granted an encumbrance (a zone in which no other HODL Concepts 
may operate) for its site. Kiosks and Counters encumber the buildings/structures in which they operate, plus any outparcels of 
that building/structure. Stores (typically a unit in a multi tenant property with walk-in space) encumber a 2-kilometer radius, 
and Centers (typically free-standing buildings which offer a full retail sales floor as well as classroom and meeting room 
space) encumber a 5-kilometer radius, defined by the shortest distance between property lines. Encumbered areas may be 
substantially reduced when located in areas of high density. Please see the section entitled ‘Territory’ for more information. 
Helpdesks do not create an encumbrance, as they are simply contracts to serve particular clients, and Nomads likewise do not 
create encumbrance, but must respect the encumbrance of existing Concepts as they move from place to place. HODL also offers an 
Area Development model, allowing for encumbrance of a larger geography in exchange for Area Developer Fees and commitments on 
development schedule. As a general rule, Area Development fees are calculated based on the number of daytime residents in a 
defined area, and Concepts are typically opened at a rate of one Concept per six months of operation. For more information 
about Area Development, please review the Area Developer Agreement.

The HODL Franchise is a collection of branded images, collateral, inventory, processes, point-of-purchase materials, packaging, 
displays, curricula, business implementation guides, and contractual relationships designed to provide entrepreneurs at nearly 
every level of capital investment the opportunity to engage their local markets with an innovative approach to adopting Bitcoin 
in daily life. HODL HQ operates specialized machinery designed to produce all of the required furnishings and media required to 
operate a Concept, and provides that material to the Franchisee. The initial shipment, which contains various materials 
depending on Concept type, is provided to the Franchisee free of charge. The Franchisee, in most cases, need only only secure 
a property for operation, establish utility and supplier accounts, complete the required training, and assemble the initial 
shipment. Ongoing point-of-purchase materials are provided free of charge, typically on a quarterly basis; and printed 
materials meant for retail are provided at cost. HODL Concepts offer a critical service - real brick and mortar locations 
where the general public can go to learn about and begin to use Bitcoin. Local businesses and many other types of organizations 
also benefit from consulting relationships with HODL Technicians during their transition to using Bitcoin in their own 
operations. HODL Franchisees are local and accessible experts in the use of the Bitcoin Network, and HODL empowers its 
operators to grow without artificial restrictions to the level of their expertise as a retailer, educator, and consultant.

A HODL Concept offers several products and services to its local market:

● LIGHTNING CLUSTERS

Lightning Clusters are Massively Multi-Signature Factories  based on Schnorr Signature Aggregation and the Channel Factories 
spec described in detail by Burchurt, Decker, and Wattenhofer in their paper entitled 'Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment 
Channel Networks'.

They provide 'liquidity-as-a-service' and are created and managed by HODL Technicians. Fees may be charged to new merchants 
when they gain control of a node within the cluster, or as payments are channeled through the cluster.

● CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND RELATED DEVICES

HODL Concepts offer product lines from companies such as Trezor, Coinkite, Ledger, Casa, Bitseed, Nodl, Cryptosteel, Billfodl, 
Yubico, Solo, and other manufacturers who produce devices for the secure storage of private cryptographic keys and Bitcoin 
software, enabling the control of digital assets, second factor authentication (2FA), production of digital signatures, etc. 
Our general belief is that the demand for devices which provide cryptographically secure authentication will rise dramatically 
in the years to come. These devices will manage our money, unlock our doors, start our cars, prove our identities, and 
eventually become the basis of reputation and credit systems in ways that have yet to be fully understood. Our Franchisees are 
expected to learn how to use these products in a variety of circumstances so that they can educate guests on the appropriate 
use of these devices. Franchisees are able to purchase these devices through our collective Buyer’s Network, which will offer 
negotiated wholesale prices on these products. Franchisees are generally able to offer these products for retail at whatever 
price point they deem appropriate, though some restrictions apply. Franchisees are forbidden from offering for retail any 
‘key-holding’ product that is not quality tested and approved by HODL HQ for security reasons. Franchisees may offer additional 
products as detailed elsewhere in this document.

● INDIVIDUAL TUTORING AND CLASSROOM EDUCATION
HODL Franchisees offer one-on-one tutoring, and group learning opportunities based around several curricula (freely provided 
by HODL HQ) to advance the mission of community understanding and adoption. Franchisees are able to market these services at 
whatever rate they deem appropriate.

● BUSINESS CONSULTING
Perhaps the most lucrative aspect of operating a HODL franchise is the opportunity to provide business consultation services 
under the HODL banner. Learning how to create a ‘Bitcoin-First’ approach to accounting and operations by opening a HODL 
franchise is the first glimpse into the value proposition that HODL has in store for businesses of all kinds. HODL HQ freely 
provides various templates for different verticals, and our library of case studies will grow as more Franchisees discover 
unique ways to integrate Bitcoin into more and more host businesses, making the value we provide to our Franchisees greater 
as our network grows. Franchisees are able to market these services at whatever rate they deem appropriate.

● HOSTING SERVICES
HODL Concepts may also offer hosting for Bitcoin Network full nodes, miners, and business software such as standard web 
services, BTCPay Server and related implementations. Franchisees are able to market these services at whatever rate they 
deem appropriate.

On this page, you will be asked to identify the entity you represent that is requesting to enter into a franchise agreement 
with us. You will also select which Concept type(s) the entity would like to develop, or whether the entity is interested in 
Area Development. In addition, you will be asked to provide a description of the physical location(s) of interest which

CONCEPT TYPES

Kiosk
A small convention-style booth or mobile apparatus designed to showcase various products. Typically staffed by one individual 
at a time, kiosks are found within other businesses or common areas of a group of business.

Nomad
A Nomad is essentially a mobile kiosk, which operates in 'pop-up' fashion at different locations. Nomads must respect the 
encumbrances of other Concepts.

Counter
Counters are like kiosks, but are usually slightly larger (and in a fixed position) and often have additional storage and/or 
display areas. The types and stock levels of products may differ from Kiosks, but Counters typically do not offer areas where 
customers may enter, and instead often utilize common areas shared by other tenants in a building/structure.

Store
Stores offer an area that customers may enter, and typically have a larger selection of products available for retail. Stores 
often also utilize some amount of common areas, like the stores in an outlet center, or mall do.

Center
A Center is typically a free-standing building, and offers to the customer a destination retail environment that contains 
classroom space, consultation space, and work space in addition to a retail sales floor. It is the largest Concept HODL employs.

HODL HQ

As mentioned previously, HODL HQ provides Franchisees with an 'Initial Shipment' would includes furnishings, posters, 
creatives, displays, wall paper, letterhead, business cards, business implementation guides, etc. HQ produces this material 
from a central warehouse using a customized corrugation and paper-making machine. All media is extruded and printed according 
to very specific criteria, and our creatives department is constantly designing new and appealing media to create an immersive, 
clean, modern, and comfortable appearance for each type of Concept. Marketing campaigns are refreshed on a quarterly basis, 
and shipped to the franchise location for assembly by the Franchisee. The initial shipment arrives palletized, so access to a 
loading dock is recommended. A Franchisee need only secure a 'Vanilla Shell' and HQ will provide the necessary components for 
a finished and professional look, which is consistent across the brand.

THE FRANCHISOR, PARENTS, PREDECESSORS, AND AFFILIATES

This Disclosure Document provides certain information about HODL Franchise Network, LLC and the terms on which it currently 
offers franchises in the United States of America (as required by federal regulations and certain state laws). This Disclosure 
Document cannot and does not provide all the information a prospective Franchisee should consider in making any decision on 
whether to enter into an Area Development Agreement or an Individual Franchise Agreement. Prospective Franchisees should do 
their own research and make an independent investigation before deciding to enter into an Area Development Agreement or an 
Individual Franchise Agreement and should consult with their own advisors, such as an attorney and/or an accountant.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “HODL,” “HODL HQ,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to HODL Franchise 
Network, LLC and all references to “Franchisee,” “their,” “they,” “you,” or “your” refer to the person who is granted the 
right to operate a HODL Concept under an Individual Franchise Agreement. If you are a corporation, limited liability company, 
partnership or any other type of legal entity, the provisions of the Individual Franchise Agreement (and, if applicable, the 
Area Development Agreement) also apply to your owners by virtue of the requirement that some or all your owners personally 
guarantee, and be personally bound by, your obligations under the Individual Franchise Agreement (and, if applicable, the 
Area Development Agreement). All initially capitalized terms used but not defined in this Disclosure Document have the 
meanings ascribed to them in the Individual Franchise Agreement and Area Development Agreement.

A. HODL FRANCHISE NETWORK, LLC
HODL is a Delaware limited liability company, which was formed on December 31, 20XX. Our principal place of business is 
123 Main Street, Seaside, Oregon 97138. Our registered agents and agents for service of process are listed in addendum 
to the IFA. As of the date of this Disclosure Document, HODL Franchise Network, LLC does business under the name HODL.

B. PREDECESSORS OF HODL
There are no predecessors of HODL.

C. HODL'S BUSINESS
HODL is in the business of operating and franchising HODL Concepts, specializing in the retail sale of electronics and 
related goods for participation in the Bitcoin Network, as well as the offering of services to facilitate such participation, 
including education and consulting. Our key offerings include a selection of hardware wallets and accessories from leading 
manufacturers, bespoke computer systems and components designed for the operation of Bitcoin Network full nodes and miners, 
hosting solutions for such equipment, classes and tutoring related to participation in the Bitcoin Network, and consulting 
services for local businesses including technology advice and software development. Our goal and vision for each location 
is for it to serve as an inviting and positive environment for building awareness of, and participation in, the Bitcoin 
Network.

D. THE PARENT AND AFFILIATES OF HODL
HODL has no parent company or affiliates at this time.

E. THE FRANCHISE
We offer to qualified persons the right to develop individual HODL Concepts at qualified locations under an “Individual 
Franchise Agreement” or “IFA”, and multiple HODL Concepts within a specific geographic area (the “Development Area”), under 
our standard form development agreement, the “Area Development Agreement” or “ADA”. A copy of our current form of the ADA 
is attached as Exhibit A. A copy of our current form of the IFA is attached as Exhibit B. The ADA requires you to open an 
agreed-upon number of HODL Concepts under a “Development Schedule”. Area Developers must, prior to opening each Concept, 
sign our then-current form of IFA for each HODL Concept they open. Each IFA will grant you the right to own and operate a 
single HODL Concept at an agreed-upon location and will require you to sell to us, at our option, your HODL Concept at a 
defined purchase price in the event that you fail to meet our established operational standards or upon the occurrence of 
certain other events as described in the Purchase Option Addendum to the IFA.

A Franchisee of HODL will operate one or more HODL Concepts. HODL Centers will normally provide a classroom environment with 
student seating, a retail sales floor displaying various goods, a cashier station, a private office for consultation, and 
offer offsite consulting and development services within a designated geographic area (See IFA for details). HODL Stores may 
or may not provide a classroom environment, as they are typically occupy smaller locations than Centers. Kiosks and Counters 
only provide retail displays and are typically staffed by only one individual at a time; and while educational and consulting 
services are offered at Kiosks, Counters, and Stores, those services are typically provided in alternate settings. All HODL 
Concepts compete in the specialty retail business for consumer electronics, the specialty service business for avocational 
education, and the specialty service business for consulting and software development. You must offer for sale all products 
and services HODL designates, unless you obtain our prior written approval not to carry certain items or provide certain 
services. To support HODL Concepts operating in small, medium, and large order consulting markets, HODL operates consulting 
only units, referred to as ‘HODL Helpdesks’. HODL may offer Franchisees the opportunity to develop Helpdesks in its discretion.

Franchisees will be required to enter into our Franchisee Software and Services Master Supply Agreement, a standard form of 
which is attached.

The products and services offered by a HODL Concept are intended primarily for personal use by the general public. As such, 
HODL has recommended designs for retail environments that are comfortable, inviting, and informative. For example, the 
creatives we share are designed to provide distinctive environments, with many options so that a Franchisee may use a variety 
of fixtures and materials complementary to the local ambiance around the Concept as a way to engage customers. The distinctive 
design and environment of the Concept, along with the services provided by a Franchisee, are intended to offer a desirable 
‘third-space’ where each visit is memorable. For many people, having a first opportunity to interact face-to-face with 
professionals in the Bitcoin Network will be a life-changing event. Our Concepts are designed to visually reinforce this 
incredible moment, and will serve as an ongoing reminder of the high level of professionalism and service they can expect 
from the HODL brand and its representatives.

F. THE COMPETITION
You will have to compete with other business offering similar products, whether online or via brick and mortar locations in 
your neighborhood. While there are no other physical businesses we know of with plans to engage the market like HODL, we 
expect that our success in any area will encourage competition very quickly, as the entire environment around Bitcoin is 
rapidly developing and a significant amount of capital is rushing in attempting to find lucrative niches in which to operate. 
Therefore, we expect the market around our Concepts to quickly become aggressively contested. When the market becomes more 
developed, it will be affected significantly by many factors, including changes in local, regional or national economic 
conditions, changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns, consumer impressions about the quality of Bitcoin-oriented 
electronics, publicity about the Bitcoin Network as a whole, trends in personal finance, and increases in the number of, and 
particular locations of, competing businesses.

Various factors can adversely affect the consumer electronics, education, and business consulting industry, including 
weather conditions; inflation; availability of and resulting increases in product costs; labor and energy costs; the 
availability and cost of suitable sites; fluctuating insurance rates; state and local regulations and licensing requirements; 
the availability of suitable electronics, adequate numbers of skilled employees; and other factors that may affect retailers 
in general. You should consider that certain aspects of any Bitcoin-related business are regulated by federal, state and 
local laws, rules and ordinances in addition to the laws, regulations and ordinances applicable to businesses generally, 
such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, Federal Wage and Hour Laws and state law equivalents, the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act, the Affordable Care Act, the National Labor Relations Act, data protection (such as credit card data 
protection under FACTA) and privacy laws. There are also regulations which govern the operation of money transmitting 
businesses, which HODL is not, but it is important to be aware of regulations focused on financial services, as the 
regulatory environment around those businesses is very dynamic and the charter of agencies designed to oversee them may 
increase suddenly, and without warning, to include other types of related businesses. State and local agencies routinely 
conduct inspections for compliance with these requirements. Under the Clean Air Act and state implementing laws, certain 
state and local areas are required to attain, by the applicable statutory guidelines, the national quality standards for 
ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matters. Certain provisions of such laws may possibly impose limits on emissions 
resulting from or energy use related to certain commercial data center operations, so Franchisees who are interested in 
offering hosted solutions should learn more about those specific regulations, and others not mentioned here.

From time to time, we may sell and franchise one or more of our company-owned HODL Concepts. In these transactions, we 
negotiate with the prospective Franchisee to reach mutually acceptable terms of a sale agreement and any lease or sublease 
of the real estate. If you purchase a company-owned Concept, you must sign an IFA and, possibly, also an ADA for further 
development in the geographic area where the purchased Concept(s) is located. Depending on the circumstances, the terms of 
which may vary from the standard terms of our IFA and ADA.

We also may offer franchises or other arrangements for HODL Concepts to be operated at non-traditional locations, such as 
transportation facilities (e.g. airports, train and/or bus stations, turnpikes or other limited access areas); colleges 
and universities; malls; sports arenas and entertainment facilities; and retail outlets, grocers and supermarkets. 
Additionally, we are currently testing alternative location formats, such as consulting-only locations, which are not 
required to receive deliveries of products and may offer franchises or other arrangements for such locations in the future. 
The terms and conditions of a franchise or other arrangements for a non-traditional location or alternative format may vary 
considerably from the standard terms of our IFA and ADA.

We, or an affiliate, may offer franchises or enter into other types of relationships for HODL Concepts in foreign countries. 
This Disclosure Document does not describe the terms of any such international agreements or relationships, but we may 
deliver this Disclosure Document in connection with such transactions for general informational purposes.

LITIGATION
HODL is not subject to any current or pending litigation in any jurisdiction. Should that change, summaries of such 
action(s) will be made available in future revisions of this document.

BANKRUPTCY
HODL has no bankrupcty actions to disclose. Should that change, summaries of such action(s) will be made available in 
future revisions of this document.

INITIAL FEES
Individual Franchisees incur no initial fees. Area Developers incur initial fees based on the geography and population 
of the Development Area, as defined in the ADA.

OTHER FEES
Subscribers to our IFA incur Royalty Fees. In all cases, the total of fees is capped at xxx of gross sales. For more 
information, see our IFA.

YOUR ESTIMATED INITIAL INVESTMENT
Your estimated initial investment in USD is approximately $20.00/sqft not including real estate costs and those costs 
uncorrelated to the basic recommended initial inventory, store furnishings, and initial marketing collateral. Since HODL 
Franchisees are largely free to make their own decisions related to size and layout of their Concept, start-up costs will 
vary widely. For more detailed estimates, please contact us for an informal evaluation of your prospective location.

FRANCHISEE’S OBLIGATIONS

both HODL HQ and the affected Franchisee. Franchisees who provide business consulting to clients outside of their encumbered 
territory must notify HODL HQ to avoid overlap and provide disclosure to potential future Franchisee who may also operate in 
that market or nearby markets, with the understanding that such relationships are generally permitted on a first-contact, 
first-served basis. Please contact us directly for more information about arbitration of competing claims to consulting 
clients by Franchisees.

staffing, training certification, human resources, marketing, development and initiatives. The annual business plan must cover 
all Concept(s) owned or operated by you and any of your Affiliates.

FINANCING
HODL HQ does not currently offer direct or indirect financing to Franchisees or Area Developers. We do not guarantee your 
notes, leases or other obligations.

FRANCHISOR’S ASSISTANCE, ADVERTISING, SYSTEMS, AND TRAINING
HODL freely offers access to its Resource Library to any Franchisee. Internal systems, controls, and trainings are offered 
in relation to specific engagements, and such offerings must be made in writing between the Franchisee, HODL HQ, and any 
relevant parties to such agreement.

Except as listed below, we need not provide any assistance to you.

A. PRE-OPENING OBLIGATIONS
We will provide the following pre-opening assistance:
We will provide Area Developers general guidance in selecting sites. We will provide you with an Operational Concept Plan 
and specifications for your Concept(s). We will also provide general guidance to you in developing your Concept(s). We will 
offer training by virtual conference to you and/or your Operating Partner and all of your personnel. However, as described 
elsewhere in this document, you will be responsible for all compensation and expenses (including labor, training materials, 
travel, meals and lodging) incurred in connection with any training programs. This training is described in detail later in 
this section. We will provide to you our Policy Manual information, either by providing you with hard copy or electronic 
materials or providing you access to online resources. If you have not previously owned or managed a Concept, we will offer 
you opening operational assistance for your first location, to be agreed upon in writing prior to giving such assistance, 
with such assistance subject to expenses to be agreed upon prior to any assistance being provided. We periodically hold an 
“Owner’s Orientation” and a “Marketing Orientation” in virtual conference. The “Owner’s Orientation” is to acquaint you and/or 
your Operating Partner with HODL’s system. You and/or your Operating Partner are required to attend an “Owner’s Orientation” 
as soon as possible after entering into an ADA or your first IFA. Your marketing director, Operating Partner, or other 
designated member of your organization must also attend at least one “Marketing Orientation”. They should attend the next 
“Marketing Orientation” after you enter into an ADA or your first IFA. In the event that we offer an existing Franchisee or 
Area Developer the opportunity to own and operate a Concept approved by us for development, such Franchisee or Area Developer 
may enter into a Development Services Agreement, pursuant to which we may provide certain development, construction and 
related services not otherwise provided under the terms of any IFA or ADA. In the event that we offer to provide development 
related consulting services to an existing Franchisee or Area Developer with respect to a location approved by us for 
development, such Franchisee or Area Developer may enter into a Real Estate Selection and Construction Management Services 
Agreement, pursuant to which we may provide certain site selection, construction and related services not otherwise 
provided under the terms of any IFA or ADA.

B. CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS
We will provide the following assistance during the operation of your Concept(s):
We will provide periodic guidance to you with regard to the HODL System (the ‘System’), including improvements and changes. 
We will periodically modify the HODL Policy Manual to reflect changes in standards, specifications and operating procedures. 
We will periodically issue specifications, standards, methods and operating procedures for the Concept(s). We will sell (or 
cause our Affiliates, Designated Suppliers or Approved Suppliers, as applicable, to sell) to you products we designate as 
required, which may change as to type and stock levels, from time to time, at our discretion. We, at our discretion, may 
administer marketing and advertising funds for the development of advertising and related programs and materials. We will 
offer periodic and on-going training programs by virtual conference for you and/or your Operating Partner and your other 
personnel. However, you will be responsible for all compensation and expenses (including labor, training materials, travel, 
meals and lodging) incurred in connection with any training programs. We, at your request and at our discretion, may provide 
you with guidance for establishing your own certified training programs for certain personnel, provided that you may not 
train any personnel until we have certified your training program as meeting our standards, which certification may be 
revoked if your training program does not continue to meet our standards. We may offer guidance to you relating to prices 
for products and services offered and sold at your Concept(s) that in our judgment constitute good business practice. You 
will not enter into any agreement or arrangement or engage in any concerted practice with competitors relating to prices at 
which products or services will be sold by you or by such competitors.

C. SITE SELECTION
You select the site for your Concept(s), subject to our acceptance. If we do not accept a site you propose, you may select 
another site, subject to our acceptance. If you enter into an Area Development Agreement with us, you must select sites 
within your specified geographic area as set forth in your Area Development Agreement. We will provide you with our standard 
site selection criteria and/or on-site evaluations of sites, as we deem appropriate. Before you acquire, by lease or 
purchase, any site for your Concept(s), you must submit a complete Site Information Package to us (included in the Site 
Selection Criteria Addendum). We will review each site information package and determine whether to accept or reject the 
site after considering factors we deem appropriate, including, without limitation, the general location and neighborhood, 
demographic information, traffic patterns, access, visibility, location of other businesses, size, configuration, appearance 
and other physical characteristics of the site. If we accept the site, we will deliver to you a signed Site Acceptance 
Letter. We will use reasonable efforts to make a site acceptance decision within thirty (30) days after we acknowledge 
receipt of a complete Site Information Package and any other materials we have requested. Your Concept(s) may not be relocated 
without first obtaining our written consent. Requests for our consent to any relocation should be made at least six (6) months 
prior to the intended closing date for the Concept(s) to be relocated and identify a proposed relocation site. As part of the 
approval process, you will also be required to submit to us additional information that we may request relating to the 
proposed relocation, including the specific reasons for the relocation and details regarding the proposed relocation site. 
In connection with the relocation policy, we may also require you to pay a relocation fee to defray some or all of HODL’s 
administrative costs related to the closing of your Concept(s) and relocating it/them to other location(s).

We estimate the time from the date you sign the IFA to the date you open your first Concept to be between three (3) and nine 
(9) months. However, this time estimate may vary depending on numerous factors including location, construction schedules, 
inventory acquisition, and financing. Under the IFA, you must lease or purchase the premises for your Concept within one 
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of our Site Acceptance Letter; must start construction of your Concept within sixty 
(60) days after the later of (a) delivery to you of the right of possession of the premises and (b) issuance of all permits 
and licenses required for construction and/or renovation of the premises; and finally, you must open your Concept within one 
hundred eighty (180) days after the start of construction.

D. TRAINING
Before opening your Concept, you and/or your Operating Partner and all general managers, assistant managers and technicians 
who have not previously graduated from our certified training programs must successfully complete the appropriate training 
program. A general manager or assistant manager will become a certified manager upon successful completion of the Retail 
Training Program. Technicians will become certified upon successful completion of the Technician Training Program, which is 
composed of learning how to efficiently deploy BTCPay Server instances and configure them for use in a variety of business 
verticals, and interface them with software such as Quickbooks, Excel, and more. You and/or your Operating Partner must 
complete both Retail Training and Technician Training, which together consist of virtual classroom training and, optionally, 
hands-on training covering all phases of operations, including Bitcoin-first operational and accounting methods, product 
display, equipment operation and maintenance, cost control, inventory control and basic techniques of management.

As of the date of this Disclosure Document, our training is taught by a certified trainer, and culminates in a test of 
product and technical knowledge and a solo video presentation that will be graded for accuracy, time management, efficiency 
and customer service. Test and presentation submissions become the property of HODL and may be used in future marketing and 
training efforts. An individual must obtain satisfactory results in the training program before obtaining certification as 
a manager or technician. Generally, training begins one hundred twenty (120) days before opening your Concept, though your 
needs may vary.

You must replace any individual who fails to successfully complete the appropriate certified training program(s) or who 
otherwise is not qualified to manage or perform the required functions at a Concept. We will not charge any fees for 
attending the training programs via virtual conference. However, you will be responsible for all compensation and expenses 
(including labor, training materials, travel, meals and lodging) incurred in connection with any training programs. Neither 
you nor your employees will receive any compensation from us for services performed during training.

E. COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
You are required to record all sales on a computer-based POS system that is capable of facilitating a fully integrated 
sales data information interface into our centralized computer system. You agree to purchase or lease, at your expense, 
POS/Computer hardware and software systems and install a data connection, power lines, modems, printers and other 
computer-related accessories and peripherals as may be required for a standard interface, for the purpose of, among other 
functions, the recording and transmission of information collected through the POS system (including, but not limited to, 
gross sales, net sales, discounts, product mix, sales by day part/hour) to centralized data collection systems. We may 
require you to use proprietary software and other computer systems which we may prescribe from time to time, and you agree 
to promptly execute such agreements and/or pay such fees as may be required to integrate enterprise tools and procedures. 
It is likely that HODL will develop a white-label POS for Franchisees to use in the near future. However, as of the date of 
this Disclosure Document, we do not require that you use any particular type or brand of POS System so long as the POS 
system software is PCI compliant with a Certified Payment Application and is capable of generating and outputting sales 
data in a machine readable format for collection within HODL’s central processing environment. You must provide such 
assistance as may be required to connect your Concept POS/Computer system with our centralized computer systems. We shall 
have the right from time to time to retrieve such data and information from your computer system(s) as deemed necessary or 
desirable, and you agree to fully cooperate with such efforts. In view of the contemplated interconnection of computer 
systems and the necessity that such systems be compatible with each other, you agree that you will comply strictly with 
all defined standards and specifications for items associated with your computer system(s). To ensure operational efficiency 
and optimum communication capability among computer system(s) installed at your Concept(s), you agree, at your expense, 
to keep your computer system(s) in good maintenance and repair, and to promptly install such upgrades, additions, changes, 
modifications, substitutions and/or replacements of hardware, software, data connectivity, electrical power, and other 
computer-related facilities, as we direct. You must upgrade or replace financial and inventory data processing and 
communications systems whenever we require it, and we have no obligation to assist you in obtaining hardware, software or 
related services. There are no contractual limits on the frequency or cost of your obligation to obtain such upgrades.

TERRITORY
The territory for business operations granted by an IFA is determined by the Concept the IFA authorizes. Kiosks and Counters 
generally encumber a territory comprised of the buildings/structures in which they operate, plus any outparcels of those 
buildings/structures. Stores (typically a unit in a multi tenant property with walk-in space) generally encumber two 
kilometers in any direction from the property line of the multi tenant property (or singular parcel if so designated), and 
Centers (typically free-standing buildings which offer a full retail sales floor as well as classroom and meeting room 
space) generally encumber five kilometers in any direction from the property line. Helpdesks do not create an encumbrance, 
as they are simply contracts to serve particular clients. The territory for business operations granted by an ADA is 
specific to the ADA, and usually includes the entirety of a municipality or multiple municipalities, but may include or be 
possessed of different boundaries. For more information about the types of Development Areas available, please contact us 
directly. To see the currently available territory, please see the territory map on our website. Please note that all 
registered concepts will have a claimed territory radius on our map of ten (10) kilometers as a default setting, to encourage 
potential franchisees to check with us before site selection near other Concepts.

A. FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
The IFA grants to you the right to own and operate a HODL Concept at a specific location. You may not conduct the business 
of your Concept at any site other than the Premises (with the exception of off-site classes and consultations), described 
in your IFA, or relocate your Concept without our prior written consent. The IFA does not provide you with any options, 
rights of first refusal or similar rights to acquire additional franchises. You may not develop a HODL Concept within the 
encumbered area of another Concept (which is either open or operating or has been approved by us for development). Except 
as otherwise noted in this document, we will not operate a Concept or grant to a third party the right to operate a Concept 
within the encumbered area of your Concept. It is anticipated that an encumbered area set forth in the Site Acceptance Letter 
generally will be used in connection with Concepts located in geographical areas of two types, although it possibly could be 
used in other circumstances as well, such as non-traditional locations. The first type is defined as an “Urban Residential 
area” which is typically defined as having a residential population greater than 50,000 people within a 5-kilometer radius 
of a site; the second type is a “City Center area” which is typically defined as having daytime population of greater than 
20,000 people within a 1⁄2-kilometer radius of a site. If both of these types apply to a location, then a “City Center area” 
criteria will be used for the encumbered area. In case of an “Urban Residential area,” we may, at our discretion, reduce the 
encumbered area to a 1-kilometer radius for areas with greater than 50,000 and less than 100,000 residential population 
within a 5-kilometer radius. When the residential population is greater than 100,000 people within a 5-kilometer radius, 
we may, at our discretion, reduce the encumbered area to a 1⁄2-kilometer radius. In case of a “City Center area,” we may, 
at our discretion, reduce the encumbered area to a 4-block polygon radius for areas with greater than 20,000 and less than 
30,000 daytime population within a 1- kilometer radius. When the daytime population is greater than 30,000 and less than 
40,000 in a 1-kilometer radius, the encumbered area is reduced to a 3-block polygon radius. When the daytime population is 
greater than 40,000 and less than 50,000 in a 1-kilometer radius, the encumbered area is reduced to a 2-block polygon radius. 
Finally, when the daytime population is greater than 50,000 in a 1-kilometer radius, we may, at our discretion, reduce the 
encumbered area to a 1-block polygon radius. Continuation of your exclusivity in the encumbered area is not dependent upon 
your achievement of a certain sales volume, market penetration or other contingency. After the IFA has been executed, we may 
not alter the encumbered area without your consent. You may not, without our prior written consent, use other channels of 
distribution, such as the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing or other direct marketing, to make sales outside the 
encumbered area. As an exception to this rule, we have the right to operate (directly or through an Affiliate) and grant 
to others the right to operate within the encumbered area:

(a) HODL Concepts or other retail electronics establishments (including those with educational or consulting components) 
using any part, no part, or all of the HODL System and Marks that are located at transportation facilities (such as airports, 
train and/or bus stations, turnpikes or other limited access highway rest stops), colleges, universities, sports arenas and 
entertainment facilities, where any of such locations or its retail operations are controlled by a third party or in our 
judgment should be operated by a third party; and

(b) Retail establishments (including electronics retailers) that we purchase (or as to which we purchase the rights as 
franchisor) that are part of another franchise system or chain, regardless whether any or all of them are converted to 
use any or all of the Marks and the HODL System or continue to be operated independently. Except for rights expressly 
granted to you under the IFA, we retain all of our rights and discretion with respect to the Marks, the HODL System and 
HODL Concepts anywhere in the world, including the right to:

(a) operate, and grant others the right to operate, HODL Concepts at locations and on terms and conditions we deem 
appropriate (you acknowledge that such HODL Concepts may be in direct competition with your Concept, without regard to 
any adverse effects of such activities on your Concept and without any obligation or liability to you);

(b) sell any products or services under any trade names, trademarks, service marks or trade dress, including the Marks, 
through other channels of distribution (including but not limited to wholesale distribution of electronics to retailers 
and other outlets and using such media as deemed appropriate including the Internet, catalog sales, telemarketing or other 
direct or indirect marketing); and (c) operate, and grant to others the right to operate, retail establishments (including 
electronics retailers) identified by trademarks, service marks or trade dress, other than the Marks, under terms and 
conditions we deem appropriate.

B. REMODELS AND UPGRADES (AREA DEVELOPMENT)
As a condition to entering into any subsequent IFA beyond your first, we may require a commitment from you to remodel the 
existing Concepts you own. You must re-equip, upgrade, and/or remodel your Concepts, pursuant to our then-current policy, 
process, plans and specifications, including, but not limited to equipment and classroom enhancements. Your failure to 
remodel the Concepts in accordance with the Remodel Schedule will be a material breach of the ADA.

TRADEMARKS
HODL has registered the trademark ‘HODL’ using the logo as seen on the cover page, as a retail and service enterprise in 
the jurisdiction of the United States of America, and plans to register other such trademarks as it deems necessary to 
create and protect its brand image in any market which it, or its Franchisees, operate. Under the IFA, we grant to you the 
right to operate a HODL Concept, under the name “HODL’ using the logo as seen on the cover page (the word ‘hodl’, capitalized, 
underlined, and displayed in the font ‘Comfortaa’ in font size at least 10x larger than any other adjacent text) and under 
any other trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and logos used at this time or that may be used in the future 
for the operation of HODL Concepts using the HODL System. HODL Franchise Network, LLC is the owner of the following 
Principal Marks, which are registered on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) 
or for which an application based on actual use or an intent to use has been filed with the USPTO:

Marks Registration/Application Number Registration/ Application Date HODL Design Registration No. 123 1/1/20xx

All required affidavits in connection with the foregoing trademarks and service marks have been filed. As of the date of 
this Disclosure Document, there are no effective material final determinations of the patent and trademark office, 
trademark trial and appeal board, the trademark administration of any state or court, and there are no pending infringement, 
opposition or cancellation proceedings, or any pending material litigation, involving the Principal Marks.

A. INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
You must use all Marks in full compliance with rules prescribed from time to time by HODL. You may not use any name or 
Mark as part of any corporate, legal or other business name (other than in connection with any legally required fictitious 
or assumed name filings) or with any prefix, suffix or other modifying words, terms, designs or symbols, or with the name 
or other approved designation of the metropolitan area or city in which the Concept is located. In addition, you may not 
use any name or Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized product or service or in any other manner that we have 
not explicitly authorized in writing. In addition to all other rights we may have for unauthorized use of the Marks or the 
sale of unauthorized products or services, you must reimburse us for any damages, liability or expenses incurred by us 
arising out of your sale of any unauthorized product or service or for any damages, liability or expenses incurred by us 
arising out of your use of the Marks in an unauthorized manner.

As of the date of this Disclosure Document, there are no agreements in effect that significantly limit the rights of HODL 
to use or license the use of other marks or the logo design in any manner material to the franchise. HODL does not know of 
either superior prior rights or infringing uses of the name “HODL” or the logo design that could materially affect your use 
of the Marks.

You must bear all costs and expenses applicable to your Concept should we decide to modify the Marks or use additional or 
substitute Marks. We will have no liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to any such required modification or 
discontinuance of any Mark or the promotion of an additional or substitute Intellectual Property. You must immediately 
notify us of any apparent infringement of or challenge to your use of any Mark, or claim by any person of any rights to 
any Mark, and you must not communicate with any person other than your legal counsel or us and our respective legal counsel 
in connection with any infringement, challenge or claim. HODL will have sole discretion to take any action it deems 
appropriate and will have the right to control exclusively any litigation or USPTO or other administrative proceeding 
arising out of any infringement, challenge or claim or otherwise relating to any Mark. You must sign any and all instruments 
and documents, provide assistance and do all acts and things as, in the opinion of our legal counsel, may be necessary or 
advisable to protect HODL’s interests in any litigation or USPTO or other administrative proceeding or otherwise to protect 
its interests in the Marks. We will indemnify you against, and reimburse you for, all damages for which you are held liable 
in any proceeding arising out of your authorized use of any Mark under the IFA and, except as provided in the IFA, for all 
costs you actually and reasonably incur in defending any claim brought against you, your Owners or Affiliates or any 
proceeding in which you are named as a party, if you have timely notified us of the claim or proceeding and you, your 
Owners and Affiliates are in compliance with the Franchise Agreement and all other agreements entered into with us and 
our Affiliates. At HODL’s sole discretion, it will be entitled to prosecute, defend or settle any proceeding arising out 
of your use of any Mark, and, if HODL decides to prosecute, defend or settle any matter, it will have no obligation to 
indemnify or reimburse you for any fees or disbursements of counsel you retain. In addition to all other rights we may 
have for unauthorized use of the Marks or the sale of unauthorized products or services, you must reimburse us for any 
damages, liability or expenses incurred by us arising out of your sale of any unauthorized product or service or for any 
damages, liability or expenses incurred by us arising out of your use of the Marks in an unauthorized manner.

B. AREA DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
The Area Development Agreement does not grant you the right to use any of the Marks. Your right to use the Marks is 
derived solely from the IFA you enter into with us. You may not use any Mark (or any abbreviation, modification or 
colorable imitation) as part of a corporate, legal or other business name (other than in connection with any legally 
required fictitious or assumed name filings), or with any prefix, suffix or other modifying words, terms, designs or 
symbols, or with the name or other designation of the metropolitan area or city in which the HODL Concept is located, 
or in any other manner (including any Internet related use such as an electronic media identifier, for websites, web pages 
or domain names) not explicitly authorized in writing by us. You may not at any time during or after the term of the Area 
Development Agreement contest, or assist any other person or entity in contesting, the validity or ownership of any of 
the Marks.

PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
Other than trademark(s), HODL does not make any claim of patent, copyright, or proprietary information except as defined 
below, as its operation is based on an open-source model. Anyone may use the information we freely provide, for any purpose, 
even for commercial purposes, under the following license:

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (removed for brevity)

OBLIGATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS
Franchisees must participate in the day-to-day operations of their business, and may not, for example, enter into an IFA 
with the intention, or practical effect, of having another entity primarily responsible for the operation of the business 
except as provided for specifically by their IFA.

If you are, or at any time become, a business corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other legal entity, 
you must designate in Exhibit A to the IFA as the “Operating Partner” an individual approved by us who must: (a) own and 
control, or have the right to own and control (subject to conditions reasonably acceptable to us), not less than ten 
percent (10%) of your equity; (b) have the authority to bind you regarding all operational decisions with respect to your 
Concept; and (c) have completed our training program to our satisfaction. You (or your Operating Partner): (a) shall exert 
your full-time and best efforts to the development and operation of your Concept and all other Concepts you own; and (b) 
may not engage in any other business or activity, directly or indirectly, that requires substantial management responsibility 
or time commitments or otherwise may conflict with your obligations under the IFA. You agree to provide us with a copy of 
any proposed arrangement, agreement or contract, and all amendments thereto, with your Operating Partner for our prior 
review and approval, and upon approval thereof, executed copies thereof. The agreement should include a provision that if 
the Operating Partner is terminated, for whatever reason, he/she shall not for a period of two (2) years after such 
termination, recruit or hire any person who is an employee of yours, ours or of any Concept operated by us, our Affiliates 
or any franchisee of ours, without obtaining the employer's consent, which consent may be withheld for any reason. We 
shall have no responsibility, liability or obligation to any party to any such arrangement, agreement or contract, or any 
amendments thereto, on account of our approval thereof or otherwise, and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless with 
respect thereto. Your Concept must, at all times, be managed by you (or your Operating Partner) or by an on-site general 
or assistant manager or a shift supervisor who has completed our training program to our satisfaction. Your manager need 
not have an equity interest in the franchise. As more fully set forth in the IFA and the ADA, you must implement all 
reasonable procedures we prescribe from time to time to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential 
Information. Such procedures may include the use of nondisclosure agreements with your owners, officers, directors, 
Operating Partners, managers, assistant managers, technicians and the like. You and your owners must deliver such 
agreements to us. At the end of the term of a IFA or ADA, you must deliver to us all Confidential Information. If you 
are a partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity, one, some or all of your owners as we 
deem necessary must undertake to be personally bound, jointly and severally, by your obligations under the IFA and ADA, 
if any. Copies of these guarantees are attached to the forms of ADA and IFA in Exhibit A and Exhibit B of this Disclosure 
Document.

RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THE FRANCHISEE MAY SELL
Franchisees may offer for retail only those ‘key-holding’ products purchased through our Buyer’s Network, but Franchisees 
are encouraged to submit for review and possible inclusion any alternative or new products for our Buyer’s Network. 
Franchisees are free to offer for retail any accessories related to ‘key-holding’ products as well as other products at 
their discretion, except for those products which, in our discretion, are detrimental to the brand image of HODL. If we 
make such a determination, we will provide notice to you of our decision to restrict you from selling particular item(s), 
such restriction to not be unreasonably applied, and such notice shall be in the form of a thirty (30) day request for 
compliance, allowing some time for the liquidation of any offending products.

RENEWAL, TERMINATION, TRANSFER, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Our IFA and ADA have renewal, termination, transfer, and dispute resolution clauses which may be negotiated for each 
agreement. For more information, please review our current IFA and ADA and contact us with any questions.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS
HODL does not represent or guarantee in any way the financial performance of its Franchisees or Area Developers. We can 
provide as much information as we are allowed to regarding the financial performance and projections of our current and 
previous Franchisees, but we do not require that current or previous Franchisees or Area Developer disclose financial 
performance or projections, except as detailed in each IFA. In addition, we require that potential Franchisees disclose 
their understanding of our lack of any guarantees of financial performance when executing an IFA or ADA.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HODL is currently pre-launch, and therefore does not have historical financial statements. As our network grows, detailed 
statements will be made available in future revisions of this document.

CONTRACTS
HODL is not encumbered by any contracts which would require disclosure in this document. Potential contracts which do not 
require disclosure, but which may be entered into by HODL, include the following:

A. DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT
HODL may enter into Development Services Agreements (attached in Exhibit) with the general public, Franchisees, or Area 
Developers, which provide that HODL may from time to time, at its discretion and on a non exclusive basis, offer to sell 
to the general public, existing Franchisees, and Area Developers services for developing locations. The price for such 
proposed location development services are the total development costs incurred by HODL, plus an additional Development 
Fee (currently ten Bitcoin [10BTC], however this fee may be modified based on location, services rendered, changes in 
actual costs and other factors determined from time to time by HODL). These costs are in addition to any developer fees 
payable in connection with Area Developers acquisition of the location. The Development Services Agreement does not provide 
any exclusive rights or territory under the agreement and HODL is not required to make any offers under the agreement. 
Likewise, the Franchisee or Area Developer is not required to accept any offers made by us. We may terminate the Development 
Services Agreement immediately upon notice for any reason or no reason. We will issue a Bill of Sale in connection with any 
items transferred to Franchisees or Area Developers in connection with the Development Services Agreement, which will 
provide the extent to which such items shall be covered by any warranties. In most instances we would expect that such 
items will remain subject to any applicable manufacturer's warranties but shall otherwise be transferred by us without 
any additional express or implied warranties.

B. REAL ESTATE SELECTION AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT
HODL may enter into Real Estate Selection and Construction Management Services Agreements (attached in Exhibit) with the 
general public, Franchisees, or Area Developers, which provide that HODL may from time to time, at its discretion and on 
a non exclusive basis, offer to provide real estate assistance services to the general public, Franchisees, or Area 
Developers (such as real estate selection and construction management services). The fees for these services are currently 
ten Bitcoin [10BTC], however this fee may be modified based on location, services rendered, changes in actual costs and 
other factors determined from time to time by HODL. These costs are in addition to any developer fees payable in connection 
with Area Developers acquisition of the location. The Real Estate Selection and Construction Management Services Agreement 
does not provide any exclusive rights or territory under the agreement and HODL is not required to make any offers under 
the agreement. Likewise, the Franchisee or Area Developer is not required to accept any offers made by us. We may terminate 
the Real Estate Selection and Construction Management Services Agreement immediately upon notice for any reason or no 
reason. Unlike the Development Services Agreement described above, HODL will provide consulting or advisory services only, 
rather than developing the Concepts and transferring possession of the Concept assets to the Franchisee or Area Developer.

C. FRANCHISEE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENT
The Franchisee or Area Developer will, prior to operating a Concept, enter into a Franchisee Software and Services Master 
Supply Agreement (attached in Exhibit) with HODL, which provides that HODL may supply to the Franchisee or Area Developer 
certain HODL owned or licensed software and other technologies to support the operation of HODL Concepts. In addition, 
under the terms of the Franchisee Software and Services Master Supply Agreement, HODL may also provide additional related 
services to Franchisees or Area Developers as may be required or requested in connection therewith from time to time. The 
specific services or software to be supplied and the fees payable will be set forth in an applicable Statement of Work on 
a project by project basis. Fees are generally structured as initial start-up fees, periodic subscription fees, percentage 
of sales fees or a combination of each depending upon the nature of the services of materials provided. We may terminate 
the Franchisee Software and Services Master Supply Agreement upon 90 days prior written notice.

D. BUYER’S NETWORK AGREEMENT
HODL uses a Buyer’s Network to aquire certain products and services on behalf of all Franchisees and Area Developers. 
Franchisees will participate in the Buyer’s Network, which requires Franchisees to order, at current retail and shipping 
prices (per manufacturer or provider advertised prices), certain products and services. Such orders are batched by HODL 
HQ on a periodic basis, which may vary from time to time. HODL HQ will negotiate with manufacturers and service providers 
in order to achieve the most advantageous terms, and will issue credits to Franchisees toward future purchases via the 
Buyer’s Network. We reserve the right to terminate the Buyer’s Network Agreement (attached in Exhibit) on a per Franchisee 
basis, or terminate the Buyer’s Network Agreement in its totality with all Franchisees upon 90 days prior written notice 
in either case.

E. HODL HELPLINE AGREEMENT
HODL HQ operates a 24-7 helpline for HODL technicians to assist in their support of individuals and businesses. Helpline 
access is offered in a variety of support packages which may include hourly rates, with or without volume subscription. 
Helpline hourly rates may differ for different support levels, for example: level one support may be charged at a certain 
rate, while level two support may be charged at a different rate. Each Helpline Agreement (attached in Exhibit) is negotiated 
prior to each IFA, but may be negotiated prior to each ADA, at our discretion.
