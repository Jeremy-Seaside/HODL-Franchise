# HODL-Franchise

This project is a collection of legal documents outlining a franchise concept for a physical Bitcoin store. I can't do it personally, so I am sharing it in the hopes that one of you will take it and run with it. But feel free to reach out with any questions as I've given this project alot of thought.

Start with the FDD.

All the best,

Jeremy
